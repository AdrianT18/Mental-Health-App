As a group we have decided to develop a web application that is focused on helping young adults with mental health problems.

The features of this application includes:

- A secure Login and Registration system which uses password encryption and JWT tokens
- A forum where the users can submit forum posts, reply to existing forum posts and delete forum posts.
- A checklist which allows users to add task, edit task, complete task and delete task. The tasks are kept confidential and only the user can see them.
- A condition search feature where the user can search in their symptoms and see possible conditions
- A mood tracker where a user can enter their current mood and track it.
